# About Me

Welcome to my personal page! I am currently a faculty member at the Escuela Nacional de Ciencias de la Tierra at UNAM in Mexico city. 

## Background

I hold a PhD from the University of Oxford on Atmospheric, Oceanic and Planetary physics. 
Throughout my academic journey, I've been fascinated by tropical meteorology and climate. Most of my research aims to better understand climate variability in the tropics through the use of climate models and observations. 
More recently, I have focused on tropical cyclone forecasts at the subseasonal-to-seasonal range. 


## Projects

- **SPEAR TC projections**: Understanding TC projections 

## Interests

Apart from coding, I have a keen interest in:

- **Photography**: Capturing moments and exploring different perspectives through the lens.
- **Music**: Playing guitar and experimenting with different genres of music.
- **Travel**: Exploring new places, experiencing diverse cultures, and embracing new adventures.

Feel free to reach out to me via [email](mailto:your.email@example.com) if you'd like to connect or collaborate on exciting projects. Let's build something amazing together!
