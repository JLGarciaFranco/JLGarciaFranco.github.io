# About Me

Welcome to my personal page! I am currently a faculty member at the Escuela Nacional de Ciencias de la Tierra at UNAM in Mexico city. 

## Background

I hold a PhD from the University of Oxford on Atmospheric, Oceanic and Planetary physics. 
Throughout my academic journey, I've been fascinated by tropical meteorology and climate. Most of my research aims to better understand climate variability in the tropics through the use of climate models and observations. 
More recently, I have focused on tropical cyclone forecasts at the subseasonal-to-seasonal range. 


## Skills

- **Programming Languages**: I'm proficient in Python, JavaScript, and Java.
- **Web Development**: I have experience with front-end frameworks like React.js and back-end technologies such as Node.js.
- **Machine Learning**: I'm currently exploring the realm of machine learning and data science, particularly focusing on neural networks and deep learning.

## Interests

Apart from coding, I have a keen interest in:

- **Photography**: Capturing moments and exploring different perspectives through the lens.
- **Music**: Playing guitar and experimenting with different genres of music.
- **Travel**: Exploring new places, experiencing diverse cultures, and embracing new adventures.
