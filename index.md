My current research aims to better understand tropical climate variability and change, specially regarding monsoons in the Americas. 
I am also interested in tropical cyclone prediction at the extended-range, so I participate in several projects of sub-seasonal-to-seasonal prediction (S2S). 
For more information about me see: 

[About](./about.md).

A detailed description of my current research projects: 

[Research Projects](./research.md).


## Courses

Currently looking for students interested in pursuing a Masters or PhD degree at UNAM. Please contact me if you are interested.

## Code and datasets

As part of various projects, I have collaborated in the creation of the following datasets and code repositories:

#### PyDropsondes

This python package was designed to analyse dropsonde data taken inside tropical cyclones. As part of my MRes at the University of Leeds, I developed this computer project to share the tools required to compute diagnostics of TC dynamics. You can find the pages describing the project [here](https://jlgarciafranco.github.io/PyDropsondes/).

#### The MSTCP dataset

* Based on the estimates of precipitation from the satellite product MSWEP v2, and the tropical cyclone tracks obtained from IBTrACS, this dataset provides estimates of tropical cyclone precipitation (TCP) including mean and maximum rainfall rates associated with all TCs from 1979-2023. 
*   Dataset is available in zenodo. [Zenodo link](https://zenodo.org/doi/10.5281/zenodo.8322962). 
*   A pre-print describing the dataset can be found [here](https://essd.copernicus.org/preprints/essd-2023-460/)
*   The repository belonging to this dataset, developed by Gabriel Morin is found here: 

#### Local Hadley and Walker circulation decomposition.

A decomposition of the tropical circulation into a meridional and zonal circulation locally can be accomplished through the method of Schwendike et al., 2014. The repository found [here](https://github.com/JLGarciaFranco/Local_walker_hadley). Written in Python, this code performs the decomposition. Further details soon.
