## Code and datasets

As part of various projects, I have collaborated in the creation of the following datasets and code repositories:


#### The MSTCP dataset

* Based on the estimates of precipitation from the satellite product MSWEP v2, and the tropical cyclone tracks obtained from IBTrACS, this dataset provides estimates of tropical cyclone precipitation (TCP) including mean and maximum rainfall rates associated with all TCs from 1979-2023. 
*   Dataset is available in zenodo. [Zenodo link](https://zenodo.org/doi/10.5281/zenodo.8322962). 
*   A pre-print describing the dataset can be found [here](https://essd.copernicus.org/preprints/essd-2023-460/)
*   The repository belonging to this dataset, developed by Gabriel Morin is found here: 

#### Local Hadley and Walker circulation decomposition.

Long, single-line code blocks should not wrap. They should horizontally scroll if they are too long. This line should be long enough to demonstrate this.
